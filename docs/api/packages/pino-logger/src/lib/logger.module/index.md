## Classes

| Class | Description |
| ------ | ------ |
| [LoggerModule](classes/LoggerModule.md) | As NestJS@11 still supports express@4 `*`-style routing by itself let's keep it for the backward compatibility. On the next major NestJS release `*` we can replace it with `/{*splat}`, and drop the support for NestJS@9 and below. |
